# Lab 2 - Command Line

First I started by entering the following commands:
```
$ hostname
$ env
$ ps
```
Here were the results:

![hostname - env](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/hostname%20-%20env.png)
![env - ps](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/env%20-%20ps.png)

Next I ran the following commands:
```
$ pwd
$ git clone https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git
$ cd iot
$ ls 
$ cd
$ df
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
```
Here were the results:

![pwd - cd demo](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/pwd%20-%20cd%20demo.png)

Next I ran the following commands:
```
$ nano file
$ cat file
$ cp file file1
$ mv file file2
$ rm file2
```
Here were the results:

![nano file](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/nano%20file.png)
![nano file - rm file2](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/nano%20file%20-%20rm%20file2.png)

Next I ran the following command:
```
$ clear
```
This command causes the terminal to reset and produces the following result:

![clear](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/clear.png)
![after clear](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/after%20clear.png)

Next I ran the following commands
```
$ man uname
```
Unfortunately this command did not work. I struggled with solving the problem but ultimately could not figure out how to. This was the error I received:

![man uname](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/man%20uname.png)

Next I ran the following commands. I received an error when trying to run ifconfig, so I believe the command was supposed to be ipconfig, which is a commonly known command.
```
$ uname -a
$ ipconfig
$ pin localhost
$ netstat
```
This was the result I received:

![uname -a](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/uname%20-a.png)
![ifconfig - netstat](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_02/ifconfig%20-%20netstat.png)
