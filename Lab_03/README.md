# Lab 3 - Python

This lab begins with moving to the proper directory using the following commands:
```
$ cd ~/iot
$ cd *3
```

Next I ran the following commands:
```
$ python3 julian.py
$ python3 date_example.py
$ python3 datetime_example.py
$ python3 time_example.py
```
This produce the following results:

![time program](https://github.com/aguadagn/2023S-EE-322-A/blob/main/Lab_03/time%20program.png)

Next I ran the following commands:
```
$ python3 sun.py 'New York'
$ python3 moon.py
$ python3 coordinates.py 'SC Williams Library'
$ python3 address.py '40.74480675, -74.02532862031404'
```
This produced the followng results:

I had a lot of difficulty getting cpu.py and battery.py to work, and was ultimately unsuccessful. I visited the following [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69644987/why-i-do-get-an-error-when-installing-the-psutil-package-for-python) to find help, but following the steps did not work.

Finally, I ran the command,
```
$ python3 documentstats.py document.txt
```

which produced this result:
