### Assignment 0: GitHub Repository

This is the repository where I will store all of my work for Design 6. It will be separated by assignment.

My goals for the semester are:
-To work on and complete at least 2 personal projects
-To succeed and pass all of my classes
-To step outside of my comfort zone and do more activities
