### Assignment 0: GitHub Repository

This is the repository where I will store all of my work for Design 6. It will be separated by assignment.

My goals for the semester are:
-To work on and complete at least 2 personal projects
-To succeed and pass all of my classes
-To step outside of my comfort zone and do more activities

One project I hope to complete is creating a Midi Stylophone. I started working on this project a few years ago but stopped after I began to struggle more with school.

> Basic git commands to remember:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

I hope to do well this semester! 👍
